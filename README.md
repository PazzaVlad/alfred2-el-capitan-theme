# El Capitan Dark and light themes for Alfred 2
This is light and dark themes for Alfred 2 that corresponds to OS X 10.11 El Capitan style. I've tuned up a color scheme, width and fonts a little bit so that it becomes more convenient for usage and better fits to dark or light mode in your system. Both of these themes are transparent so I recommend you turn on the "Windows blur" mode in Alfred (Settings - > Appereance -> Option - > Windows blur). 


This how light version is looks like:
